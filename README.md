# TRADE SIMULATION
#### Video Demo:   <https://youtu.be/UNNoYUq_n-8>
#### Description:
##### Purpouse:
Trade is an intiative to incentivise newcomers into trading. Most new traders are afraid of investing as they fear financial loss. With our simulation, we hope to minimise the fear of the financial world as well as provide newcomers with a risk free trading environment before they tackle real word trading.

This project is an initiative to build on the code I used for CS50 FINANCE by adding more functionalities and pages and completely changing  the look of the project.


### Features
- Contains an Information Page to Inform users on the simulation.
- Allows for login and registering of users and works in the basis of sessions.
- Contains tooltips, popups as well as modals to simplify user experience.
- Getting the Prices of Publicly Traded Company Shares.
- Generates a Graph for Every Stock Price the User is Interested in.
- Generates YahooFinance Information for Every Plublicly Traded Company.
- Enables Selling and Purchasing of Stocks


### In the future:
I wish to keep working on this project and I want to add more functionalities in the future :

- Email login and email verification.
- Graphs for more financial data.
- Graphs appearing in the same page as stock price and being interactive in real-time.
- More popups being provided to guide the user more and make the project feel more like a simulation.
- Advice being prompted when the trader has lost value of stock.
- Posibility of user to not only buy and sell at market price but also at the prices of other traders, thus simulating a more realistic environmen where the trader has to judge wether a trade is benefitial or not.

#### Tech:
- coded on VScode.
- The web application is created using Flask.
- The webpages of the project are created using html, javascript, css , jQuery and jinja.
- Bootstrap templating was used to create the webpages.
- The graph was created using pandas, numpy and matplotlib.
- toolboxes were implemented using bootstrao.

#### Specifications:
- a modal was created to welcome newcomers. This is done by using javascript to only show the modal once per user, as soon as they log in after registering.
- The site shows the yahoo finance page for every stock by grabbing the stock ticker from the input in quotes and formatting it inside a strandard yahoo finance url. This makes it possible to generate the yahoo finance page for every stock.

##### That is all !!
